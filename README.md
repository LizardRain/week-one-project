# WHAT IT DOES
* You can press a variety of buttons that have names of Bugsnax on them
* When you press the button, its name will be drawn in a new window
* When you press another button after that, the old name will be erased and the new name will be written in its place

# HOW IT WORKS
1. A GET request to the Bugsnax API [insert link here] retreives the data for all Bugsnax
2. The name of each Bugsnax is parsed out of this response
3. Each name is given a button
4. When the button is pressed, a class method is run which allows a turtle to draw the word
